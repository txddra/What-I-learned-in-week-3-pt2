## Week 3, Day 0
- learning to avoid merge conflicts
  
  
  ### Do’s and Don'ts

**Don’t**:
*edit a file on GitHub : you can’t push up your changes...*


**Do**:
*Always do a “git pull” before doing a “git push”*

 ---
### **__JAVASCRIPT__**

- *abrivated as “JS”*
- it’s not the same as **“Java”** - js was written in about 10 days, by netscape, made really quickly, to showcase programs. 
- **Very different** 

- closer to C/python under the hood.
- the brains of the operation- adds functionality

- Uses `a (<script src =“script.js”></script>)` tag at the bottom so that it shows the functionality from the js loaded.
  
__Declaring variables__ :

- _“Const”_
- _“let”_


**Don’t use “VAR”, Colin and Mesi will freak_**


### __Data types__:
* **Strings** : _words, letters, symbols, emojis_
* **Numbers**: … _includes 0_
* **Booleans: true _or_ false.

  __Non values__
* **NaN**:(Not a Number)
* **Null**: intentionally never given a value.
* **Undefined**: haven’t gotten around to it yet

### Strings & Numbers:

*Strings* are written with quotes.
(*can use single or double quotes*)
