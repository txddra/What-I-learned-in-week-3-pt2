---
### The answer is...

---
## Week 3, Day 0
- learning to avoid merge conflicts
  
  
  ### Do’s and Don'ts

**Don’t**:
*edit a file on GitHub : you can’t push up your changes...*


**Do**:
*Always do a “git pull” before doing a “git push”*

 ---
### **__JAVASCRIPT__**

- *abrivated as “JS”*
- it’s not the same as **“Java”** - js was written in about 10 days, by netscape, made really quickly, to showcase programs. 
- **Very different** 

- closer to C/python under the hood.
- the brains of the operation- adds functionality

- Uses `a (<script src =“script.js”></script>)` tag at the bottom so that it shows the functionality from the js loaded.
  
__Declaring variables__ :

- _“Const”_
- _“let”_


**Don’t use “VAR”, Colin and Mesi will freak_**


### __Data types__:
* **Strings** : _words, letters, symbols, emojis_
* **Numbers**: … _includes 0_
* **Booleans: true _or_ false.

  __Non values__
* **NaN**:(Not a Number)
* **Null**: intentionally never given a value.
* **Undefined**: haven’t gotten around to it yet

### __Strings & Numbers__:

*Strings* are written with quotes.
(*can use single or double quotes*)

*Numbers* are written with the number (*duh*), if it’s quotes it’ll assume the number character of the alphabet


*Semicolons* in **JavaScript** are the equivalent to periods ending a sentence. 
<!-- most basic building block og our data -->


**Strings**:
_Concatenation_ - “smooshing"

**if there’s an apostrophe in your string there are ways to get around it** :
- using a “\”
- using double quotes(“string”)



### __VARIABLES__.
 you can ‘declare/save’ content by using these labels. keywords

`let`
`const`
 
 then anything that comes after that is what’s going to be the place holder.
 
i.e.

`
Let user = ‘Mesura Kaleziq’;
User; 
Let powerlevel = 9001;
Powerlevel;
`
 but let isn’t very concrete

## Week 3, Day 1

We don’t use VAR



Just type in “node” in any terminal
it immediately runs js

jest is going to the tester for our code
      


### __FUNCTIONS__

A WAY TO DO, FLOW CONTROL
runs the same code whenever you neef it without repeating yourself
easily see what a bit of code is supposed to do
Figure out why it’s not doing what it’s suppose to, debugging

parts of a function

the word function declares the function - like let for variables


**Scope**
what happens in functions stays in functions
inside a function, you can look at the code “outside”.
but to code outside the code inside is an impenetrable box

but code outside cant see anything in



Global variables
=================



## Week 3 // Day 2

**Debugging**

in vscode it has a lot of tabs to view things going on in what
Breakpoints; here’s where the code will stop 

`
**Watch**: watches them as it goes.

“+” : adds expressions to view as you go along in your code

“x” : removes all

“-“ : adds in an expression




==============

_function technique_: **RETURN**


- whatever is *immediately* after the return becomes the output of our function
- If you don’t add return in your function then javascript returns undefined for you. 


**don’t quokka and debug @ the same time**
